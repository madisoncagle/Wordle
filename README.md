## About Regina
My bot Regina plays Wordle by starting off with the same 2 words before selecting a valid word from `five_letter_words.txt` for her subsequent guesses. With her current algorithm, Regina's average is `~5.6` and her win percentage is `~70%`.  

***Note: Regina is not AI.***

### ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨
The file `scores.csv` contains all of Regina's Wordle data, including the answers. Thus it may contain today's word. View this file with caution if you enjoy Wordle but haven't solved today's puzzle. Play [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) now for a guaranteed spoiler-free route.  

> P.S. Give no regard to the `file_of_shame.csv`
